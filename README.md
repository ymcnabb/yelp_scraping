Code for scraping business info and reviews from yelp

This code was intended for getting info on petshops in Amsterdam as part of a data science project for a new petshop in Amsterdam. In order to gain insight about what customers like about and lack in petshops, I looked at correlations between reviews, ratings and other features of the businesses. This is my first ever scraping code, so comments are welcome!
